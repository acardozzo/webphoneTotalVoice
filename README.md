WEBPHONE HIDDEN


The Webphone is WebRTC webphone that was design to work in direct in the browser and TotalVoice service provider create a RESTful approach to communicate with their Janus server. As it works direct on the browser the code must be loaded on that to load webRTC client and connect with SIP server.

The process is very easy. 

To work on a Angular 2+ project we need to install (npm i jquery and) and load jquery.

Once the page is loaded the webphone nees only 1.5 ~5 seconds to be ready to use.
